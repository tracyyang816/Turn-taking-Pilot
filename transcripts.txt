Okay, quick checklist talk — we've got that Northern Star Navigation book, right?
Yup. Honestly, that book is priceless — when the GPS dies, knowing how to read the sky and the stars keeps us oriented.
Especially up here where landmarks are buried in snow; stellar navigation plus simple sextant tricks could point us to camp or a known ridge.
And if clouds block the stars, the book's chapters on using horizon cues and estimating latitude from the sun are still useful.

Next — the magnetic compass. Basic, but lifesaving when the sky is overcast.
Agreed. Pair it with the star book for backup: use the compass for a bearing, use star/sun methods to check for magnetic anomalies or local deviation.
A small compass can also help us mark travel legs — walk 500 meters on a bearing, turn 90°, and so on. Good for search patterns.

What about water purification tablets? Critical. Melted snow isn’t sterile — those tablets kill pathogens and make the water drinkable.
Right — melt, let it cool, treat, then wait the required time. They’re lightweight compared to boiling fuel and can prevent dysentery or worse.

And that little bottle of Bacardi rum we dragged along — not just for morale.
(laughs) True. Small amounts help warm your insides temporarily and keep spirits up. Also, in emergencies you can use it as a disinfectant for small wounds or to sterilize a needle, or even as a fire-starting accelerant if mixed carefully.
Plus barter value if we meet other survivors — but, yeah, mainly morale and a few antiseptic uses.

So together: navigation knowledge, compass bearings, safe water, and a tiny multipurpose bottle of rum — that's a decent survival combo.
Agreed. Lightweight, redundant navigation, drinking water covered, and a few improvisational uses for the rum.
